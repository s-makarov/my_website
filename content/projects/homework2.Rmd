description: Here I present a quick graphic analysis of COVID-19 statistics with respect to comorbidities and ICU admissions. It utilizes a little more advanced dataset and ggplot functions than the ones presented in "My First Steps with ggplot"

# CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data.

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()

```

Given the data we have, we produce two graphs that show death % rate:

- by age group, sex, and whether the patient had comorbidities or not

```{r, fig.width = 12, dpi = 180}

covid_comod <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(medcond_yn == "Yes" | medcond_yn == "No") %>% 
  filter(death_yn == "Yes" | death_yn == "No") %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male" | sex == "Female") %>%
  filter(age_group != "Unknown", age_group != "Missing", !is.na(age_group)) %>% 
  # filter(race_and_ethnicity_combined != "Unknown", !is.na(race_and_ethnicity_combined)) %>%
  group_by(sex, age_group, medcond_yn)  %>%
  summarise(prop = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n()) %>% 
  mutate(medcond_yn = case_when(
           medcond_yn == "Yes" ~ "With comorbidities",
           medcond_yn == "No" ~ "Without comorbidities"
         )) %>%
  mutate(prop = round(prop*100, 1))


ggplot(covid_comod, aes(x = prop, y = age_group)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#6f7ba2", alpha = 0.9) +
  facet_grid(medcond_yn ~ sex) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       caption = "Source: CDC") +
  geom_text(aes(label = prop, x = prop + 3)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(prop) paste0(prop, "%"))

```


- by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r, fig.width = 12, dpi = 180}

covid_icu <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(icu_yn == "Yes" | icu_yn == "No",
         death_yn == "Yes" | death_yn == "No"
         ) %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male" | sex == "Female") %>% 
  filter(age_group != "Unknown", !is.na(age_group)) %>% 
  filter(race_and_ethnicity_combined != "Unknown", !is.na(race_and_ethnicity_combined)) %>%
  group_by(sex, icu_yn, age_group, death_yn) %>% 
  summarize(ttl = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = ttl/sum(ttl),
         icu_yn = case_when(
           icu_yn == "Yes" ~ "Admitted to ICU",
           icu_yn == "No" ~ "No ICU"
         )) %>% 
  filter(death_yn == "Yes") %>% 
  mutate(prop = round(prop*100, 1))

ggplot(covid_icu, aes(x = prop, y = age_group)) +
  geom_col(fill = "salmon", alpha = 0.85) +
  facet_grid(icu_yn ~ sex) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU",
       x = "",
       y = "",
       caption = "Source: CDC") +
  geom_text(aes(label = prop, x = prop + 3)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(prop) paste0(prop, "%"))

```
